AdobeWebM
=========

This is a project where I'm building plug-ins for Google's [WebM](http://www.webmproject.org/) format to be used inside the various Adobe applications.

Right now there's a working WebM plug-in for Premiere Pro, along with a [WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/) plug-in for Photoshop. Both are considered to be beta releases.

To download binaries, check my postings on the relevant [discussion](https://groups.google.com/a/webmproject.org/group/webm-discuss) [forums](https://groups.google.com/a/webmproject.org/group/webp-discuss), where I will post links.
