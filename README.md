AdobeWebM
=========

This is a project where I'm building plug-ins for Google's [WebM](http://www.webmproject.org/) format to be used inside the various Adobe applications.

Right now there's a working WebM plug-in for Premiere Pro, along with a [WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/) plug-in for Photoshop. Both are considered to be beta releases.
